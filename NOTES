  
For some reason this causes a space leak:

  let msgs = (map snd) <$> unfoldWhileM (toBool.fst) (getMessage hwnd (Nothing, Nothing))
  msgs >>= sequence_.(map dispatchMessage)

Vulkan extensions rely on external symbols to be defined. My solution to the problem is to to use "type" aliases for such types and
always defined them in terms of Foreign.C.Types and Foreign.Ptr types, which is inevitable since those are always native types. Structs
are never passed by value in the APIs, only by pointer, and Haskell doesn't support by-value passing anyway.
